## üéØ **Priority 1: Critical Improvements (High Impact)**

### 1. ‚ö° **Learning Rate Scheduling Implementation**
**Current Issue**: Flat learning rate throughout training (5e-5 constant)
**Problem**: Missing adaptive learning that could improve convergence

**Solutions to Implement:**

#### A. **ReduceLROnPlateau Scheduler** ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**
```python
# Add to training_config.py
LR_SCHEDULER_PATIENCE = 3        # Reduce LR after 3 epochs without improvement

LR_MIN = 1e-7                    # Minimum learning rate floor
```
**Why it helps**: Automatically reduces LR when validation loss plateaus, enabling finer convergence
**Expected improvement**: 5-15% better final RMSE

    def forward(self, pred, target):
        rmse = self.rmse(pred, target)
        ssim = 1 - self.ssim_loss(pred, target)  # Convert SSIM to loss
