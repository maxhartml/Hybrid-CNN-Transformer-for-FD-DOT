# NIR-DOT Noise Modeling: Clinical Realism for Machine Learning

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced noise modeling implementation for NIR-DOT phantom simulations, designed to bridge the gap between idealized computational models and real-world clinical measurements. The noise model implements clinically-validated characteristics observed in frequency-domain NIR systems to improve machine learning model robustness and generalization.

## Background and Motivation

### The Problem with Idealized Simulations

Traditional NIR simulation pipelines often apply minimal noise to maintain numerical stability, resulting in unrealistically clean data:

- **Perfect laboratory conditions**: SNR ~60 dB (signal 1,000,000× stronger than noise)
- **0.1% amplitude noise**: Equivalent to precision research instrumentation
- **±0.1° phase noise**: Laboratory-grade lock-in amplifier performance

### Real-World Clinical Reality

Clinical NIR systems operate under challenging conditions with multiple noise sources:

- **Electronic noise**: Detector dark current, amplifier thermal noise
- **Environmental interference**: Ambient light, electromagnetic interference  
- **Mechanical vibrations**: Patient movement, probe positioning variations
- **Temperature drift**: Component performance variations over time

**Result**: Clinical systems typically achieve SNR ~25-30 dB, significantly lower than simulation assumptions.

### Impact on Machine Learning

Models trained on unrealistically clean data often fail when deployed on real clinical systems due to:
- **Overfitting to noise-free conditions**
- **Poor generalization to real measurement variance**
- **Inability to handle realistic signal degradation**

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Complex Gaussian Noise Model

#### Mathematical Foundation

NIR measurements are inherently complex-valued in frequency-domain systems:
```
y = A·e^(iφ) = A·cos(φ) + i·A·sin(φ)
```

Where:
- `A` = amplitude (photon fluence magnitude)
- `φ` = phase delay relative to source modulation
- `i` = imaginary unit

#### Noise Addition Process

Complex Gaussian noise is applied with equal variance in real and imaginary components:

```
n_real ~ N(0, σ²)    # Real component noise
n_imag ~ N(0, σ²)    # Imaginary component noise
y_noisy = y + n_real + i·n_imag
```

This approach preserves the physical relationship between amplitude and phase while introducing realistic measurement uncertainty.

### 2. Piecewise Log-Linear Variance Model

#### Theoretical Basis

Real NIR systems exhibit signal-dependent noise characteristics due to:
- **Shot noise**: Proportional to √(signal strength)
- **Electronic noise floor**: Constant regardless of signal level
- **Dynamic range limitations**: Increased noise at high signal levels

#### Implementation Structure

The noise variance follows a two-segment piecewise model:

```
σ(signal_dBm) = {
    σ_floor                    if signal_dBm < -51 dBm
    a·signal_dBm + b          if signal_dBm ≥ -51 dBm
}
```

#### Noise Floor Region (< -51 dBm)

**Physical meaning**: Signals below -51 dBm are dominated by electronic noise floor.

**Characteristics**:
- Constant noise level: 3.0% of signal
- Independent of signal strength
- Represents fundamental detection limits

**Clinical relevance**: Deep tissue measurements often approach this threshold due to light attenuation.

#### Linear Increase Region (≥ -51 dBm)

**Physical meaning**: Above noise floor, signal-dependent effects dominate.

**Characteristics**:
- Linear increase with signal level (in dB scale)
- Slope parameter: `a = 0.0015` (dB⁻¹)
- Intercept parameter: `b = 0.08`

**Clinical relevance**: Surface and shallow measurements with stronger signals exhibit proportional noise increase.

### 3. Frequency-Dependent Scaling

#### Motivation

NIR systems use different modulation frequencies (typically 100-140 MHz) with distinct noise characteristics:
- **Higher frequencies**: Increased electronic noise, better depth sensitivity
- **Lower frequencies**: Reduced noise, limited depth penetration

#### Implementation

Frequency-specific parameters are applied based on modulation frequency:

**100 MHz systems** (lower noise):
```
σ_floor = 0.02    # 2% noise floor
a = 0.001         # Gentler slope
b = 0.05          # Lower intercept
```

**140 MHz systems** (higher noise, better clinical performance):
```
σ_floor = 0.03    # 3% noise floor  
a = 0.0015        # Steeper slope
b = 0.08          # Higher intercept
```

### 4. Signal-to-Noise Ratio Impact

#### Quantitative Comparison

**Previous implementation**:
- Amplitude noise: 0.1% of signal
- SNR: 60 dB (unrealistic)
- Noise ratio: 1:1000

**Enhanced implementation**:
- Amplitude noise: 3.0% of signal (frequency-dependent)
- SNR: 30 dB (clinically realistic)
- Noise ratio: 1:33

#### Clinical Validation

The 30 dB SNR target aligns with published performance specifications for commercial frequency-domain NIR systems, ensuring training data reflects real-world measurement conditions.

## Validation Against Clinical Literature

### Empirical Basis

The piecewise log-linear model is derived from empirical characterization of real NIR systems through:

1. **Multi-distance phantom measurements**: Various source-detector separations (20-40 mm)
2. **Multi-frequency characterization**: System response at different modulation frequencies
3. **Statistical analysis**: Log-linear regression of noise variance vs. signal level

### Published Methodology Alignment

This implementation follows established protocols for NIR noise characterization:

- **Measurement domain**: Noise applied to complex frequency-domain signals (not voxel space)
- **Statistical model**: Zero-mean complex Gaussian with empirically-derived variance
- **Calibration approach**: Per-frequency parameter fitting from phantom data
- **Averaging effects**: Implicit integration time scaling (clinical systems use 1-5 second averaging)

### Clinical System Specifications

Typical commercial FD-NIR systems report:
- **SNR range**: 25-35 dB depending on SDS and tissue properties
- **Phase precision**: ±1-3° for strong signals
- **Detection threshold**: -50 to -55 dBm noise floor

Our model parameters fall within these validated ranges.
