Enhanced Metrics Implementation Summary - Step 2 & 3 Complete
===========================================================

This document summarizes the comprehensive enhanced metrics system implemented
for the NIR-DOT reconstruction pipeline, covering both Step 2 (Core Metrics)
and Step 3 (Feature Analysis).

Implementation Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
Date: August 7, 2025
Author: Max Hart

## üìä STEP 2: Enhanced Metrics (COMPLETE)

### Core Reconstruction Metrics
‚úÖ **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Metric)**
   - Multi-channel support for absorption and scattering
   - 3D volume-aware computation with proper padding
   - Range: -1 to 1 (higher = better similarity)

‚úÖ **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**
   - Measures reconstruction quality in decibels
   - Numerical stability with epsilon handling
   - Typical range: 20-40 dB for good reconstruction

‚úÖ **Channel-Specific RMSE**
   - Separate RMSE for absorption (Œº‚Çê) and scattering (Œº‚Çõ)
   - Overall RMSE for general comparison
   - Enables detailed tissue property analysis

### W&B Integration
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Logging**
   - All metrics automatically logged to Weights & Biases
   - Proper epoch tracking and step management
   - Organized metric categories (train/, val/, Charts/)

‚úÖ **Stage-Specific Support**
   - Stage 1: Reconstruction metrics only
   - Stage 2: Reconstruction + feature analysis metrics
   - Backward-compatible chart logging

## üî¨ STEP 3: Feature Analysis (COMPLETE)

### Advanced Feature Metrics (Stage 2 Only)
‚úÖ **Feature Enhancement Ratio**
   - Measures transformer improvement over CNN features
   - Formula: ||enhanced - cnn|| / ||cnn||
   - Higher values indicate more significant enhancement

‚úÖ **Attention Entropy**
   - Measures attention distribution diversity
   - Higher entropy = distributed attention
   - Lower entropy = focused attention
   - Enables attention pattern analysis

### Model Comparison Support
‚úÖ **Baseline vs Enhanced Comparison**
   - All metrics available for both modes
   - Feature analysis shows transformer contribution
   - SSIM + PSNR primary quality indicators
