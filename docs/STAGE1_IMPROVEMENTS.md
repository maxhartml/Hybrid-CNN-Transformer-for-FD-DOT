## üéØ **Priority 2: Architecture Optimizations (Medium-High Impact)**

### 4. üèóÔ∏è **Model Architecture Refinements**

#### A. **Attention Mechanisms in CNN** ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**
```python
# Add spatial attention to encoder
class SpatialAttentionBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, channels):
        self.attention = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv3d(channels, channels//8, 1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv3d(channels//8, 1, 1),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )
```
**Why it helps**: Helps model focus on important regions (tumor areas)
**Expected improvement**: 10-15% better absorption channel reconstruction

#### B. **Deeper Residual Blocks**
```python
# Current: 1 residual block per layer
# Proposed: 2-3 residual blocks per layer

**Expected improvement**: 5-10% better feature learning

### 5. üîß **Loss Function Enhancements**

#### A. **Multi-Scale Loss** ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**
```python
class MultiScaleLoss(nn.Module):

        self.ssim_loss = SSIMLoss()
        
    def forward(self, pred, target):
        rmse = self.rmse(pred, target)
        ssim = 1 - self.ssim_loss(pred, target)  # Convert SSIM to loss
        return 0.7 * rmse + 0.3 * ssim
```
**Why it helps**: Balances reconstruction accuracy with structural similarity
**Expected improvement**: Better visual quality, 5-12% SSIM improvement

#### B. **Channel-Weighted Loss**
```python
# Weight absorption and scattering differently
absorption_weight = 2.0  # Higher weight for harder channel

EPOCHS_STAGE1 = 100              # Increase from 50
EARLY_STOPPING_PATIENCE = 15    # Increase patience
```
**Why it helps**: Your model was still improving at epoch 50
**Expected improvement**: 5-10% better final performance

#### B. **Progressive Training Strategy**
```python
# Stage 1a: 30 epochs with higher LR (1e-4)
# Stage 1b: 50 epochs with lower LR (5e-5)
# Stage 1c: 20 epochs with very low LR (1e-5)
```
**Why it helps**: Coarse-to-fine optimization
**Expected improvement**: Better convergence, 3-8% improvement

### 7. üíæ **Regularization Enhancements**

#### A. **Advanced Dropout Strategy**
```python
# Spatial dropout for 3D data
class SpatialDropout3d(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, drop_rate=0.1):
        # Drop entire feature maps instead of individual elements
```
**Why it helps**: Better regularization for 3D data
**Expected improvement**: Reduced overfitting, better generalization

#### B. **Weight Decay Scheduling**
```python
# Start with higher weight decay, reduce over time
initial_weight_decay = 5e-4
final_weight_decay = 1e-5
```
**Why it helps**: Strong initial regularization, fine-tuning freedom later
**Expected improvement**: Better optimization path
