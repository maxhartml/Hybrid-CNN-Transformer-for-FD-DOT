## ✅ **COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS (High Impact)**

### 1. ⚡ **AdamW + OneCycleLR Optimization** ⭐ **COMPLETED**
**Status**: ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED**
**Implementation Date**: August 2025

**What was implemented:**
```python
# Research-validated configuration in training_config.py
ADAMW_BETAS_STAGE1 = (0.9, 0.95)     # CNN-optimized momentum
STAGE1_MAX_LR = 3e-3                 # Peak learning rate
STAGE1_PCT_START = 0.2               # 20% warmup phase

## 📋 **PLANNED IMPLEMENTATIONS (Next Phase)**

### 4. 🧠 **Spatial Attention Mechanisms** ⭐ **PLANNED NEXT**
**Status**: 📋 **PLANNED (After 5K baseline establishment)**
**Timeline**: Post-5K phantom baseline training

**Research Foundation:**
- **Medical Imaging**: Oktay et al. (2018) - "Attention U-Net: Learning Where to Look"
- **Computer Vision**: Woo et al. (2018) - "CBAM: Convolutional Block Attention Module"

**Planned Implementation:**
```python
class SpatialAttentionBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, channels):
        super().__init__()
        self.attention = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv3d(channels, channels//8, 1),  # Compress channels
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv3d(channels//8, 1, 1),         # Generate attention map
            nn.Sigmoid()                          # Normalize to [0,1]
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        attention_map = self.attention(x)         # [B, 1, D, H, W]
        return x * attention_map                  # Element-wise enhancement
```

**Why it helps NIR-DOT specifically:**
- **Tumor Focus**: Attention learns to focus on regions with optical property changes
- **Background Suppression**: Reduces noise in homogeneous tissue regions
- **Absorption Enhancement**: μₐ has lower contrast than μₛ' - attention amplifies weak signals
- **Parameter Efficiency**: Only +0.03% parameters (~2K vs 6.98M total)

**Expected Improvements:**
- **Absorption Reconstruction**: 10-15% better μₐ quality
- **Tumor Detection**: Enhanced contrast and edge definition
- **Interpretability**: Attention maps show clinical relevance

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Phase 1**: Establish 5K phantom baseline without attention
2. **Phase 2**: Add attention to 2-3 deepest encoder layers only
3. **Phase 3**: Ablation study comparing with/without attention

### 5. 🔄 **Advanced Data Augmentation** ⭐ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

- Gaussian noise injection (σ=0.01)
- Elastic deformations (mild)
```

**Expected Improvements:**

- **Robustness**: Better performance on real-world variations
- **Overfitting Reduction**: More diverse training patterns

### 6. 📈 **Multi-Scale Loss Functions** ⭐ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

        self.ssim_weight = 0.3      # Structural similarity
        self.perceptual_weight = 0.1 # Feature-space loss
        
    def forward(self, pred, target):
        rmse_loss = F.mse_loss(pred, target).sqrt()
        ssim_loss = 1 - ssim(pred, target)
        perceptual_loss = self.compute_perceptual_loss(pred, target)
        
        return (self.rmse_weight * rmse_loss + 
                self.ssim_weight * ssim_loss + 
                self.perceptual_weight * perceptual_loss)
```

### 8. 🔬 **Channel-Weighted Loss**
**Status**: 📋 **RESEARCH IDEA**

**Concept:**
```python
# Weight absorption and scattering differently
absorption_weight = 2.0  # Higher weight for harder channel
scattering_weight = 1.0
```

**Justification**: Absorption coefficient (μₐ) has inherently lower contrast and is harder to reconstruct accurately.
