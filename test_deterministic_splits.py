"""
Test script to verify deterministic dataset splitting works correctly.

This script tests that:
1. Dataset splits are identical across multiple runs
2. Split indices are exactly as expected (0-7999, 8000-8999, 9000-9999)
3. No phantom appears in multiple splits (no overlap)
4. All phantoms are included in exactly one split (no gaps)
