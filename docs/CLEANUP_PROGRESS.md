## ðŸš¨ Suspicious Logic (None Found)
No suspicious logic patterns were identified. The codebase appears to follow sound ML practices:
- Stage 1 trains CNN autoencoder on standardized data
- Stage 2 trains transformer on latent space with end-to-end validation
- Proper data standardization prevents leakage
- Checkpoint management is consistent

## ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements

### Large Function Decomposition (Optional)
Several functions exceed 100 lines and could be broken down for maintainability:
- `data_analysis.py`: `visualize_dataset()` (228 lines) â†’ extract plot generation helpers
- `data_simulator.py`: `run_fd_simulation_and_save()` (361 lines) â†’ extract simulation steps
- `stage2_trainer.py`: `train_epoch()` (157 lines) â†’ extract validation logic
- `stage1_trainer.py`: `train_epoch()` (134 lines) â†’ extract batch processing

### Performance Optimizations (Minor)
- Consider using `torch.jit.script` for inference-only model components
- Evaluate `torch.compile` for training loops once PyTorch 2.1+ is available
- Monitor memory usage patterns in large batch processing

### Code Quality Enhancements (Low Priority)
- Add type hints to remaining function signatures
- Consider using `dataclasses` for configuration objects
- Implement proper configuration validation with `pydantic`

## âœ… Cleanup Complete
The NIR-DOT codebase is now clean, consistent, and production-ready. All critical issues have been resolved:

- **Import hygiene**: Proper organization and no redundant imports
- **Constant management**: Hardcoded values replaced with proper configuration
- **PyTorch compatibility**: Modern patterns and proper compatibility handling
- **Logging consistency**: Debug prints converted to proper logging
- **Path handling**: Cross-platform compatible path operations
- **Code integrity**: No corrupted code or undefined references

The codebase follows modern Python and PyTorch best practices and is ready for production use.
