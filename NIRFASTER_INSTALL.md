# NIRFASTer-FF Installation

The NIRFASTer-FF library (~79MB) is excluded from Git to keep repository size manageable.

## Installation Instructions

1. Download NIRFASTer-FF from the official repository
2. Extract/clone it to this directory so the structure looks like:
   ```
   nirfaster-FF/
   ├── nirfasterff/
   ├── meshes/
   ├── docs/
   ├── tutorials/
   └── README.md
   ```

## Usage

The `data_simulator.py` script automatically imports and uses NIRFASTer-FF for finite element light transport modeling. Ensure the library is installed before running simulations.
