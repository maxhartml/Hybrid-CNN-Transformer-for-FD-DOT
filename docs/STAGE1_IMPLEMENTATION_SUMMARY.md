STAGE 1 TRAINING IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
=======================================

This document summarizes the comprehensive changes implemented for Stage 1 training
with ground truth normalization as requested.

CHANGES IMPLEMENTED:
===================

1. GROUND TRUTH NORMALIZATION
   - ✅ Created PerChannelZScore utility in code/utils/standardizers.py
   - ✅ Per-channel z-score normalization for μₐ and μ′ₛ independently
   - ✅ Fits mean/std only on training split at start of training
   - ✅ Transform/inverse-transform for normalized/raw space conversion
   - ✅ State persistence for Stage 2 reuse

2. TRAINING LOOP CHANGES (Stage 1)
   - ✅ Train on standardized targets (normalized RMSE loss)
   - ✅ Clean console logs: only standardized RMSE + LR during training
   - ✅ W&B logs: train/loss_std, train/lr
   - ✅ Removed Dice/Contrast from training (validation only)

3. VALIDATION LOOP CHANGES (Stage 1) 
   - ✅ Forward pass on standardized targets (consistency with training)
   - ✅ Inverse-transform predictions/targets for raw metrics
   - ✅ Compute human-interpretable metrics in raw μₐ/μ′ₛ space
   - ✅ W&B logs: val/loss_std, val/raw_rmse_total, val/raw_rmse_mu_a, 
       val/raw_rmse_mu_s, val/raw_dice, val/raw_contrast
   - ✅ Console shows raw metrics for human interpretation

4. STANDARDIZER UTILITY
   - ✅ Created code/utils/standardizers.py with PerChannelZScore class
   - ✅ .fit(y) computes mean/std per channel over training samples
   - ✅ .transform(y) applies standardization
   - ✅ .inverse_transform(y_std) reverses standardization
   - ✅ .state_dict() and .load_state_dict() for persistence
   - ✅ Works on 3D volumes [B, 2, D, H, W]

5. DATASET/LOADER INTEGRATION
   - ✅ Stage 1 trainer receives raw ground truth from dataset
   - ✅ Normalization applied inside trainer loops (not dataset)
   - ✅ Prevents accidental fitting on val/test data

6. W&B METRIC DEFINITIONS
   - ✅ Updated metric definitions for clean separation
   - ✅ train/* uses training_step as x-axis (for smooth LR curves)
   - ✅ val/* uses epoch as x-axis (for epoch-wise metrics)
   - ✅ Removed Dice/Contrast from training logs
   - ✅ Raw metrics only in validation logs

7. IMAGE LOGGING
   - ✅ Inverse-normalize predictions and ground truth before visualization
   - ✅ All logged images in raw μₐ/μ′ₛ space (not standardized)

8. CHECKPOINT ENHANCEMENT
   - ✅ Save standardizer state in checkpoint for Stage 2 reuse
   - ✅ Include both standardized loss and raw metrics in checkpoint

KEY FILES MODIFIED:
==================

- code/utils/standardizers.py           [NEW] - Per-channel z-score utility
- code/training/stage1_trainer.py       [MODIFIED] - Complete rewrite for standardization
- code/training/training_config.py      [MODIFIED] - Added missing constants
- code/utils/visualization.py           [USED] - Already works with raw data

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA MET:
=======================

✅ Train only on standardized μₐ/μ′ₛ
✅ Show only standardized RMSE and LR for training batches in console and W&B
✅ Show both standardized loss and raw-space metrics for validation in console and W&B  
✅ All metrics computed on correct data space (normalized vs raw) consistently
✅ Normalization stats saved and can be loaded for Stage 2
✅ Clean code with consistent naming in metric logs

USAGE:
======

The implementation is complete and ready for training:

1. Set CURRENT_TRAINING_STAGE = "stage1" in training_config.py
2. Run: python code/training/train_hybrid_model.py
3. The system will automatically:
   - Fit standardizer on training data once at start
   - Train on standardized targets
   - Validate with raw metrics for human interpretation
   - Save standardizer state in checkpoint for Stage 2

The implementation ensures that:
- Training happens in standardized space for stable optimization
- Validation metrics are computed in raw space for interpretability  
- All logging clearly separates standardized vs raw metrics
- Stage 2 can reload and reuse the standardizer
