## **📊 Part I: The Data Foundation - From Physics to Training Data**

### **1.1 The Physics Engine: Digital Tissue Creation** 
*📁 `code/data_processing/data_simulator.py`*

**The Challenge**: Create realistic digital phantoms that mirror real human tissue

**The Solution**: A sophisticated physics-based simulator that:

```python
# Each phantom is a complete medical imaging scenario:
phantom_volume = (64, 64, 64)      # 64mm³ clinical volume at 1mm resolution
tissue_properties = 2              # [μ_a, μ_s] absorption + scattering coefficients
measurements_per_phantom = 1000    # 50 sources × 20 detectors optimal coverage
training_subset = 256              # Subsampled for data augmentation
```

**🔬 The Phantom Generation Process:**

1. **Volumetric Construction**: Creates 3D tissue geometries with:
   - Random ellipsoidal healthy tissue (25-30mm radius)
   - Multiple tumor inclusions (5-10mm radius) 
   - Random 3D rotations eliminate directional bias
   - 80% tumor-tissue embedding prevents "floating" artifacts

2. **Optical Property Assignment**: Physiologically realistic values:
   - Healthy μ_a: 0.003-0.007 mm⁻¹ (absorption)
   - Healthy μ_s: 0.78-1.18 mm⁻¹ (scattering)  
   - Tumor enhancement: 1.5-3.5× absorption, 1.5-2.5× scattering

3. **Finite Element Modeling**: NIRFASTer-FF simulation:
   - Tetrahedral mesh generation (1mm³ elements)
   - 140MHz frequency-domain diffusion equation solving
   - Surface-constrained probe placement (clinical realism)
   - 10-40mm source-detector separations (optimal for 1mm resolution)

**🎯 Output**: HDF5 files containing complete medical scenarios:
- `ground_truth`: (2, 64, 64, 64) tissue property volumes
- `log_amplitude`: (1000,) measurement data  
- `phase`: (1000,) measurement data
- `source_pos`: (1000, 3) probe positions
- `det_pos`: (1000, 3) probe positions

### **1.2 The Data Pipeline: Smart Loading & Augmentation**
*📁 `code/data_processing/data_loader.py`*

**The Innovation**: Phantom-level batching with measurement subsampling

**Why This Matters**: 
- Prevents data leakage (phantoms never split across train/val/test)
- Enables massive data augmentation (3.9× more training combinations)
- Maintains clinical realism (complete phantom scenarios)

**🔄 The Data Flow:**

```python
# Smart data loading strategy:
Generated_measurements = 1000       # Full clinical probe coverage
Training_subset = 256              # Random subsample for augmentation  
Batch_phantoms = 4                 # Complete phantoms per batch
Total_batch_measurements = 1024    # 4 phantoms × 256 measurements
```

**🧬 Revolutionary Tissue Patch Extraction** *(Just implemented!)*:

The missing piece was **tissue patch extraction** - this creates local anatomical context:

```python
def extract_tissue_patches_from_measurements():
    # For each measurement:
    # 1. Extract 16×16×16 patches around source + detector
    # 2. Convert to interleaved format [μ_a[0], μ_s[0], μ_a[1], μ_s[1], ...]
    # 3. Handle edge cases with zero-padding
    # Output: (256_measurements, 2_patches, 8192_interleaved_data)
```

**Data Augmentation Benefits**:
- Different measurement subsets each epoch
- Different tissue patch contexts  
- 3.9× effective dataset expansion
- Robust generalization to unseen scenarios

## **🏗️ Part II: The AI Architecture - Hybrid Intelligence**

### **2.1 The Spatial Expert: 3D CNN Autoencoder**
*📁 `code/models/cnn_autoencoder.py`*

**The Role**: Learn what realistic tissue looks like before solving inverse problems

**Architecture Philosophy**: Parameter-efficient spatial feature learning

```python
# Optimized CNN Architecture (6.98M parameters):
Input:  (batch, 2, 64, 64, 64)     # Dual-channel tissue properties

            # ENHANCED PATH: Training with anatomical context
            tissue_context = self.tissue_encoder(tissue_patches)  # [batch, 8]
            enhanced_input = torch.cat([nir_measurements, tissue_context], dim=1)  # [batch, 16]
            features = self.enhanced_projection(enhanced_input)  # [batch, 256]
        else:
            # BASELINE PATH: Clinical inference (NIR only)  
            features = self.baseline_projection(nir_measurements)  # [batch, 256]
        return {'features': features}
```
