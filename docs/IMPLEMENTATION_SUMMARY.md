# Measurement-Specific Tissue Fusion Architecture Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented the complete measurement-specific tissue fusion architecture throughout the NIR-DOT codebase. This implementation fixes the architectural mismatch that was causing Stage 2 performance degradation and provides the foundation for improved reconstruction quality.

## Architecture Overview

The new architecture implements measurement-specific tissue fusion that maintains 1:1 correspondence between NIR measurements and tissue patches, replacing the problematic token concatenation approach that lost spatial-measurement relationships.

### Key Components

#### 1. SpatiallyAwareEmbedding (`spatially_aware_embedding.py`)
- **Purpose**: Robin's exact measurement/position processing approach  
- **Input**: 8D NIR measurements [log_amp, phase, src_xyz, det_xyz]
- **Output**: 256D hi_tokens with spatially-aware embeddings
- **Key Features**:
  - Separate processing for measurement features and spatial coordinates
  - Learned positional encoding for source/detector locations
  - Combined projection to 256D embedding space

#### 2. TissueFeatureExtractor (`spatially_aware_embedding.py`)  
- **Purpose**: Measurement-specific tissue patch processing with learned fusion
- **Architecture**: Shared CNN for source/detector patches → learned fusion
- **Input**: Tissue patches [batch, n_measurements, 2, patch_volume*2]
- **Output**: Enhanced tokens [batch, n_measurements, 256]
- **Fusion Strategy**: Learned fusion (user-preferred option B)
  ```
  hi_token [256D] + tissue_features [256D] → concat [512D] → MLP → enhanced_token [256D]
  ```

#### 3. SpatiallyAwareEncoderBlock (`spatially_aware_embedding.py`)
- **Purpose**: Complete encoder block orchestrating measurement-tissue fusion
- **Modes**:
  - **Baseline**: Returns hi_tokens unchanged (preserves original performance)
  - **Enhanced**: Returns tissue-enhanced tokens (new fusion capability)
- **Key Innovation**: Maintains measurement-specific tissue correspondence

#### 4. GlobalPoolingEncoder (`global_pooling_encoder.py`)
- **Purpose**: Post-transformer processing matching ECBO 2025 architecture
- **Input**: Raw transformer output [batch, seq_len, embed_dim]
- **Output**: Encoded scan [batch, encoded_scan_dim] for CNN decoder
- **Features**: Global average pooling + FC projection

## Implementation Details

### Architecture Flow
```
Stage 2: NIR measurements → SpatiallyAwareEncoder → Transformer → GlobalPooling → CNN decoder
```

1. **NIR Processing**: 8D measurements → 256D spatially-aware tokens
2. **Tissue Fusion**: Optional tissue enhancement maintaining measurement correspondence  
3. **Transformer**: Self-attention across enhanced measurement tokens
4. **Global Pooling**: Sequence aggregation for CNN decoder interface
5. **Reconstruction**: Pre-trained CNN decoder generates final output

### Key Design Decisions

#### Fusion Strategy B (Learned Fusion)
- **Rationale**: User preference for flexible, trainable fusion
- **Implementation**: MLP-based fusion of hi_tokens + tissue_features
- **Benefits**: Adaptive fusion weights, optimal information integration

#### Same CNN for Source/Detector Patches
- **Rationale**: Shared feature extraction with separate processing
- **Implementation**: Single CNN processes both patch types independently
- **Benefits**: Parameter efficiency while maintaining spatial distinction

#### Baseline Mode Preservation
- **Rationale**: Ensure enhanced mode doesn't degrade baseline performance
- **Implementation**: `use_tissue_patches=False` returns hi_tokens unchanged
- **Benefits**: Fallback option and performance validation

### Architectural Fixes

#### Shape Compatibility
- **Issue**: Transformer encoder was aggregating tokens before global pooling
- **Fix**: Return raw transformer output [batch, seq_len, embed_dim] for proper pooling
- **Result**: Correct information flow through the architecture

#### Reference Cleanup
- **Removed**: All "Robin Dale" references as requested
- **Replaced**: With generic "ECBO 2025" or architectural descriptions
- **Maintained**: Technical accuracy while removing personal references

#### Logging Optimization
- **Reduced**: Excessive debug logging in attention mechanisms
- **Maintained**: Critical debug information for development
- **Improved**: Performance and readability
