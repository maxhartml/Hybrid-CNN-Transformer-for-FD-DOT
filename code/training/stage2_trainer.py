"""
Stage 2 Training: Transformer Enhancement with Frozen CNN Decoder.

This module implements the second stage of the two-stage training pipeline,
focusing on training transformer components while keeping the pre-trained
CNN decoder frozen. This approach leverages the robust feature representations
learned in Stage 1 while adding sophisticated spatial modeling capabilities.

The training process supports both baseline and enhanced modes:
- Baseline: Standard transformer training without tissue context
- Enhanced: Transformer training with tissue patch integration for improved
  spatial awareness and context-sensitive reconstruction

Classes:
    RMSELoss: Root Mean Square Error loss function for reconstruction optimization
    Stage2Trainer: Complete training pipeline for transformer enhancement

Features:
    - Frozen CNN decoder to preserve Stage 1 learned features
    - Optional tissue patch integration for enhanced spatial modeling
    - Progressive learning with reduced learning rates
    - Comprehensive checkpoint management and experiment tracking
    - Support for both baseline and enhanced training modes
